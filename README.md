# Console Finances

## Description
The motivation behind this challenge was to use JavaScript to analyse a large array of data to calculate the following:
- The Total Number Of Months In The Set Of Data.
- The Net Total Amount Of Profit/Losses Over The Entire Period.
- The Average Change In Profit/Losses Over The Entire Period.
- The Month Included In The Period That Saw The Biggest Increase In Profits.
- The Month Included In The Period That Saw The Biggest Increase In Losses.

Throughout working on this challenge I have learnt the following:
- Arrays
- Nested Arrays
- Array Methods
- Loops
- Push
- Math.min( )
- Math.max ( )

## Usage
To access the work of this challenge, you will need to access the console of the web browser. This can be done by either right clicking and selecting "Inspect" or using the shortcut Ctrl + Shift + C. When the web page first loads the user will be greeted with an alert advising them to open the console. When opening the console the results of the calculations and acceptance criteria will be visible in the following format:

It is important to note here that the outcomes featured on the console is flexible so if data is added or removed to the original array, the results featured on the console will update.
